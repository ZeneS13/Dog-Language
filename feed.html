<h2>Treatment of overeating</h2>
   <h3> If you do have a dog that would gobble down anything
        — and especially if that dog is overweight — then 
        you have to take control as the Pack Leader. 
        Consult your vet on your dog’s actual dietary needs per day,
         create a regular feeding ritual and schedule for your dog,
          and stick to it. Don’t let anyone in the house give him human 
          scraps or handouts, and only give treats when your dog has earned them
           by doing a job and then showing calm, submissive energy.
You can also slow the gobbling with special bowls that have pillars in them that
 the dog has to eat around or, if you want a cheaper low-tech solution, you can put 
 a tennis ball in the dish, which she’ll have to nose around.
     When you start with this schedule, leave the food down until the first
      time your dog walks away from the bowl, whether he’s eaten everything 
      or not, then take the bowl away. This will help reinforce the idea that
       this is meal time and he won’t be finding more food until the next meal time.

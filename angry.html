    <h2>Causes for your dog to be angry.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3>Dogs get mad when they're being taunted, teased, mistreated, threatened, groomed...
          Sometimes dogs get mad when they shouldn't because they're being territorial, or because they're fearful.
          Sometimes dogs are right to get mad because a person or another animal is being mean to them.
       </h3>
    


<h2>How to tell that your dog is angry?
  <ol>
        <li>Lunging.</li>
        <li>Posturing.</li>
        <li>Direct eye contact.</li>
        <li>Raised hackles.</li>
        <li>Pricked ears.</li>
        <li>Teeth exposed toward the other dog.</li>

  </ol>  
</h2>

<h2>If the dog is angry at you:
 <ol>
  <li> Do not make eye contact with the dog, this is confrontational.</li>
  <li>Dogs are fight or flight, try not to advance towards the dog. Avoid sudden/jerky movements.</li>
  <li>Avoid using high pitched voices around it, stick to low and calm “Easy…” .</li>
  <li>Back up slowly, small short steps at a time until you are at a safe distance.</li>
  </ol>

If the dog is angry at someone/something else:
<ol>
<li>Advise whoever he is angry at of the above, so they don’t engage the fight instinct.</li>
<li>Call the dog away from the situation, try motivating with treats.</li>
<li>Try using phrases with words of things he likes (Ball, go for a walk, treat ect).</li>
<li>If all of this is not effective, intervene. Keep in mind the dog may redirect and bite you.
Even if they know you and love you, they may not realize it’s you before it’s too late.
 Intervene with something he will recognize the smell of, like a leash.</li>
</ol>

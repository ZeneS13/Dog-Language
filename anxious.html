    <h2>Causes for your dog to be Anxious.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3> The 3 main causes are fear, seperation and ageing. 
           Fear-related anxiety can be caused by loud noises, strange people or animals,
            visual stimuli like hats or umbrellas, new or strange environments,and specific situations.
            Dogs with separation anxiety are unable to find comfort when they are left alone or separated from their family members. 
            Age-related anxiety affects older dogs and can be associated with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). 
            In dogs with CDS, memory, learning, perception, and awareness start to decline, similar to the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease in humans.

<h2>Treatment</h2>
   <h3> The best way to treat anxiety is to talk with your veterinarian.
     Your veterinarian can help you identify the type of anxiety your dog suffers from and the possible causes and triggers.
      Your veterinarian will also be able to help you determine if the anxiety is simply situational, 
      or if it is becoming an overwhelming issue for your dog. 
      Additionally, veterinarians can also rule out any other medical conditions that could be causing your dog’s symptoms.
<br>
      There are several training strategies owners can use to treat dog anxiety. 
      One way is counterconditioning. The purpose of counterconditioning is to change your dog’s response
       to the stimuli responsible for anxiety, usually by replacing the anxious or aggressive behavior
        with a more desirable behavior, like sitting or focusing on the owner.

      Another training strategy is desensitization. The owner slowly introduces the dog to the source of anxiety,
       preferably in small doses and at a decreased intensity.
        Repeated exposure and rewarding positive behavior can go a long way toward managing anxiety.

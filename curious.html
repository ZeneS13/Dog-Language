    <h2>Causes for your dog to be Curious.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3> A dog's curiosity is most likely compounded by the fact that dogs have a 
           very strong sense of smell and sight. 
           Dogs are able to pick up on things than humans cannot, such as minute smells
            and very high and very low-pitched sounds.
            Dogs feel an urge to explore and to gain information about the world around them.

<h2>How to make your dog explore new things.</h2>
   <h3> Dogs have an innate sense of curiosity built into their nature, 
       so try to encourage activity and exercise using that trait to encourage your 
       dog to try something new. Changing your dog's schedule will breathe new life
        into their routine and make it more interesting.

<br>
If your dog is bored, give them a curiosity box to explore.
 While you can buy these from online firms or pet shops, 
 it is easy just to make your own. Try packing a few 
 things that your dog will love into a big box then closing the lid. 
  Your dog will be all eyes and they will want to know what is 
  in the box! With their fabulous sense of smell, they will smell a 
  treat inside, and when you give them permission to investigate,
   watch your dog go barking mad! Rewards that they find in the box are theirs to keep, but they have to work for it.
   <br>
How to make it: 
&nbsp;
Step 1.Fill a large box with a selection of dog gifts. 
It might be some full sized treats, a new rubber toy, a squeaky ball, 
or whatever your dog will like. Wrap each treat or toy in a separate smaller box, bag, or just wrap in a plain wrapping.
&nbsp;
Step 2. Fill a small cardboard box with shredded paper 
and sprinkle in some small treats for your dog to find.
 Put a toy into a bag. A squeaky toy is ideal, as when the
  dog bites the bag it will make a noise! Fill the large box 
  with your smaller bags and boxes. Your dog will be overwhelmed 
  with their curiosity! Get creative, wrap a toy and tie it with a treat. 
  Do what it takes to make your dog hunt and satisfy their inquisitive nature.
  &nbsp;
  Step 3.
  Invite your dog into the room and let them sniff around the box.
   Don't rush it, but when they keep looking at you as though to say 
   'can I check it out', give them the order to go. You may have to help 
   to get them started, but it won't take long. Before long that dog is 
   going to destroy that box because they can smell good stuff inside. 
   As they find one treat after another, lavish them with praise and congratulate them.
    They will take ages and they will probably keep checking the box to make sure they found everything.

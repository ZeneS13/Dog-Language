    <h2>Causes for your dog to be Stressed.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3> The 3 main causes are fear, seperation and ageing. 
           Fear-related anxiety can be caused by loud noises, strange people or animals,
            visual stimuli like hats or umbrellas, new or strange environments,and specific situations.
            Dogs with separation anxiety are unable to find comfort when they are left alone or separated from their family members. 
            Age-related anxiety affects older dogs and can be associated with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). 
            In dogs with CDS, memory, learning, perception, and awareness start to decline, similar to the early stages of Alzheimerâ€™s disease in humans.

       the obvious way to ease their mind is to never leave them alone.

    Massage the dog. 
    Try Music Therapy. 
     Give Time-Out. 
    Try Calming Coats/T-Shirts and try to have
    Alternative Therapies.

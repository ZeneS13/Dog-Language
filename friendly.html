    <h2>Causes for your dog to be Friendly.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3> In looking at overly friendly dogs, researchers found that they carry two variants of genes 
           called GTF2I and GTF2IRD1. Those are the same genes that, when absent in human beings, 
           cause Williams syndrome—a condition in which there’s a surplus of oxytocin, a.k.a. the love hormone.

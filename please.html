    <h2>Causes for your dog to be Begging.</h2>
        <br>
       <h3>  Begging is actually a learned behavior, meaning someone has taught the dog that begging works.
            Dogs are relatively simple creatures and if they perform a behavior that results in a reward,
             they will repeat the behavior expecting a reward in the future. Luckily, with the right amount
              of consistency, begging is a behavior that can be corrected quite easily – If it doesn’t result 
              in a payoff, your dog will have no reason to repeat.

<h2>how to make your dog stop begging.</h2><h2></h2>>
   <h3> Begging is a bad habit, but many dog owners actually encourage it.
        This can lead to digestive problems and obesity. Dogs beg because they love food. 
        However, table scraps are not treats, and food is not love. 
        Yes, it is hard to resist that longing look, but giving in "just this once" creates a problem in the long run.
         When you teach your dog that begging is permitted, you are sending the wrong message.

    Before you sit down to eat, tell your dog to go to its place,
     preferably where it will not be able to stare at you. If necessary, 
     confine your dog to another room. If it behaves, give it a special 
     treat only after you and your family are completely finished eating.
